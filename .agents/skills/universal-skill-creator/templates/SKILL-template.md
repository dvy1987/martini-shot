# [Skill Title]

You are a [specific expert role] specializing in [narrow domain]. Your outputs
are [quality standard — e.g., "precise and immediately deployable"] and
[distinctive characteristic — e.g., "always cite the exact command or file path"].

## STRICT RULE: 200-Line Limit

This SKILL.md MUST remain under 200 lines to ensure context efficiency.
If content exceeds this limit, move detailed documentation, schemas, or secondary workflows to the `references/` directory.
Refer to them here with clear instructions on when the agent should read them.

## When to Load This Skill

Load this skill when the user:
- Asks to [action trigger 1]
- Mentions [keyword 1] or [keyword 2]
- Has a file of type [extension] and wants to [action]
- Needs to [action trigger 2]

Do NOT load this skill for: [anti-trigger — narrow the scope to prevent false activations]

---

## Core Workflow

### Step 1 — [Action Verb] [Object]

[Specific instruction. State what "done" looks like: acceptance criteria, not vague.]

If [edge case condition]:
- [Handle it this specific way — not "handle appropriately"]

### Step 2 — [Action Verb] [Object]

[Specific instruction. Reference Step 1 output explicitly.]

### Step 3 — [Action Verb] [Object]

[Specific instruction.]

### Step 4 — Verify Output

Before presenting the final response, confirm:
- [ ] [Criterion 1 — specific and checkable against the output]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] Output is complete — no truncated sections, no TODO placeholders
- [ ] Format matches the Output Format section exactly

If any criterion fails, revise before presenting.

---

## Gotchas

<!-- 
Gotchas are the highest-value content in many skills.
These are NON-OBVIOUS facts the agent will get wrong without being told.
Keep these in SKILL.md (not references/) so the agent reads them before encountering the situation.
Each bullet is a concrete correction, not general advice.
-->

- [Specific non-obvious fact that defies reasonable assumptions]
- [Environment-specific behavior that breaks the obvious approach]
- [Naming or identifier inconsistency that causes hard-to-debug errors]

---

## Output Format

Always structure your response as:

```
[Section title]: [Description of content]
[Section title]: [Description of content]
[Section title]: [Description of content]
```

**Always include:** [List of elements that must appear in every output]
**Never include:** [List of elements to omit — conversational filler, apologies, etc.]

<!-- 
Alternative: provide a concrete template instead of a schema.
Agents pattern-match better against concrete structure than prose descriptions.

Use this exact template:

---
**Summary:** [1-2 sentence overview]
**Key Findings:**
- [Finding 1 with supporting evidence]
- [Finding 2 with supporting evidence]
**Recommendation:** [Specific actionable next step]
**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low] — [one-line rationale]
---
-->

---

## Examples

<!-- 
Include 2-3 realistic examples. Make inputs representative of real user queries.
Make outputs complete and production-ready — never abbreviated with [...].
Cover at least 2 distinct scenarios (not just variations of the same case).
-->

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>[Realistic user request — as they would actually type it, not a simplified version]</input>
    <output>
[Complete, production-ready output. This is the gold standard — never truncate.
If the ideal output is long, include the full thing.]
    </output>
  </example>
  <example>
    <input>[A different scenario that exercises a different workflow branch or edge case]</input>
    <output>
[Complete output for this scenario. Show how the skill handles variation.]
    </output>
  </example>
</examples>

---

## Scope and Constraints

**In scope:**
- [Capability 1 — specific and bounded]
- [Capability 2]

**Out of scope — disclaim and redirect:**
- [What this skill explicitly does NOT handle]
- [What requires human judgment beyond this skill — state how to escalate]

**Hard rules:**
- Always state assumptions explicitly rather than guessing
- Prefer [approach A] over [approach B] when [condition]
- [Any non-negotiable behavior — phrased positively]
