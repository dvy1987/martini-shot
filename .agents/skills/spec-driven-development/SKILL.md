  Orchestrator for spec-driven development (SDD) — the discipline of writing
  executable specs before code, with a constitution above them and a hard
  cross-check gate before implementation. Mirrors GitHub Spec Kit / AWS Kiro
  slash-command shape. Routes /constitution, /specify, /clarify, /plan,
  /tasks, /analyze, /implement to the right leaf skill. Load when the user
  says "spec-driven development", "SDD", "specs-first workflow", "run the
  spec loop", "/specify a feature", "/plan from this spec", "do spec-driven
  for this", "GitHub Spec Kit workflow", "Kiro workflow", or invokes any
  SDD-style slash command. Single entry point for all SDD workflows.

# Spec-Driven Development

You are the SDD Orchestrator. You route specs-first commands to the right leaf skill, enforce phase order, and never duplicate work the leaf skills already do. You are a thin router — the leaf skills do the heavy lifting.

## Hard Rules

Never write artifacts directly — always delegate to the leaf skill.
Never skip phase order: constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement.
Never run `/implement` without a passing `/analyze`.
Never run `/plan` without an Approved feature spec.
Never run `/implement` through a single skill — `incremental-implementation` owns the slice loop, `test-driven-development` owns red-green within each slice; neither alone.
Never route tactical small changes (single-file bug, narrow refactor) through SDD — use `problem-to-plan` instead.

## Phase Map

| Slash command  | Intent                                  | Routes to                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `/constitution`| author or amend project rules           | `project-constitution`                              |
| `/specify`     | write a new feature spec                | `feature-spec` (mode=specify)                       |
| `/clarify`     | resolve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers   | `feature-spec` (mode=clarify)                       |
| `/plan`        | turn approved spec into a phased plan   | `implementation-plan` (consumes feature-spec)       |
| `/tasks`       | derive agent-pickable tasks             | `implementation-plan` (tasks-only mode)             |
| `/analyze`     | hard readiness gate                     | `spec-crosscheck`                                   |
| `/implement`   | execute the plan                        | `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development` (red-green per slice) |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify entry point

Read the user's message. Detect:
- Explicit slash command (`/specify`, etc.) — route directly.
- Named intent ("write a spec for X") — map to the matching slash.
- Ambiguous request ("do SDD for X") — start at the lowest unmet phase.

### Step 2 — Detect current SDD state

Silently check:
- `docs/constitution.md` exists?
- Latest `docs/specs/*-feature-spec.md` for the slug — what status?
- Matching `docs/plans/<slug>-plan.md` and `<slug>-tasks.md` (or `-TODO.md`)?
- Latest `docs/reviews/<slug>-spec-crosscheck.md` — verdict?

### Step 3 — Enforce phase order

Refuse to run a later phase if an earlier one is missing. Examples:
- `/specify` requested but no constitution → offer to run `/constitution` first (do not auto-run without confirmation).
- `/plan` requested but spec status ≠ Approved → run `/clarify` first.
- `/implement` requested but no PASS crosscheck → run `/analyze` first.

### Step 4 — Delegate

Invoke the routed leaf skill. Pass:
- The feature slug
- Paths to upstream artifacts
- The mode parameter where relevant
- For `/implement`: the spec's AC list — each slice starts Red from that AC's failing-test skeleton (`feature-spec` schema → Test Skeletons)

Do not duplicate the leaf skill's work — once delegated, the leaf is in charge until it returns.

### Step 5 — Summarize and offer next phase

After the leaf returns, summarize what was produced and offer the next slash command:
> "/specify complete. Spec saved at <path> (status: Draft, 2 CLs). Next: `/clarify`."

## Gotchas

- This is a router, not a worker. Resist writing constitution/spec/plan content here — that belongs in the leaf skill.
- For tactical small changes (bug fix, narrow refactor), DO NOT route through SDD. Route to `problem-to-plan`. SDD overhead is for feature-sized work.
- **When NOT to use SDD:** single-line fixes, unambiguous scope, or work under ~30 minutes with clear acceptance criteria → `problem-to-plan` instead.
- A repo can have many feature-specs in flight. Use the slug to tie spec ↔ plan ↔ tasks ↔ crosscheck. Don't mix slugs across phases.
- `/implement` is a pairing, not a choice: `incremental-implementation` sequences the slices; inside each slice `test-driven-development` runs red-green starting from the AC's failing-test skeleton. A slice is done only when its AC's test passes. (Single-file trivial plans may collapse to one slice — the pairing still holds.)
- Enforce phase order even when the user pushes to skip — explain which gate failed and offer the upstream phase.

## Example

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>Do spec-driven development for adding magic-link login.</input>
    <output>
SDD state check:
- Constitution: docs/constitution.md@2 ✓
- No spec yet for "magic-link login"

Starting at `/specify`. Routing to `feature-spec` (mode=specify).

[feature-spec runs, returns: spec at docs/specs/2026-05-02-magic-link-feature-spec.md, status: Draft, 2 CLs]

`/specify` complete. 2 clarifications open. Run `/clarify` next, or paste answers and I'll route them to `feature-spec`.
    </output>
  </example>
</examples>

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple for a spec" | Even two-line acceptance criteria beat guessing. |
| "I'll spec after coding" | That's documentation, not specification. |
| "Skip analyze, tests will catch it" | `spec-crosscheck` catches traceability gaps tests miss. |
| "Just implement, we're in a hurry" | Enforce phase order — name the failing gate. |

## Verification

- [ ] Orchestrator routes child skills in correct order
- [ ] Phase order respected (no implement without PASS analyze)
- [ ] Correct leaf skill invoked; slug consistent across artifacts

---

## Red Flags

- Router writes constitution or spec content directly
- Tactical bug fix forced through full SDD pipeline
- Ambiguous SDD request starts at wrong phase
- Child skill skipped for explicit slash command route

## Prune Log
Last pruned: 2026-07-09
- /implement now enforces incremental-implementation + test-driven-development together, red-green per slice from AC skeletons (agent-loom Phase 5, SDD×TDD)
