  Measure, profile, and fix performance bottlenecks — Core Web Vitals, backend

# Performance Optimization

Measure before optimizing. Profile first, fix the proven bottleneck, measure again, then guard against regression.

## Hard Rules

- Never optimize without a **baseline measurement** (synthetic + real-user when possible).
- Fix the **actual bottleneck** — not the most interesting code.
- One change at a time when validating; otherwise you cannot attribute wins.
- Set **budgets** (LCP, bundle KB, p95 latency) and fail CI when exceeded.
- Document what you measured, what you changed, and the delta.

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Good | Needs work | Poor |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| LCP | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| INP | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Measure baseline

- **Frontend:** Lighthouse (synthetic), DevTools Performance, `web-vitals` RUM.
- **Backend:** APM, query logs with timing, p50/p95/p99 on critical endpoints.
- Record environment, device, and data volume.

### Step 2 — Identify bottleneck

Use symptom → probe map:

```
Slow first load → bundle size, render-blocking, LCP element
Slow interaction → INP, main-thread long tasks, layout thrash
Slow API → N+1 queries, missing indexes, cold starts
Memory growth → leaks, unbounded caches, retained DOM
```

### Step 3 — Fix narrowly

Prefer highest-impact, lowest-risk fixes: indexes, caching, code-split, image sizing, defer non-critical JS.

### Step 4 — Verify

Re-run the **same measurement** as Step 1. Report before/after numbers.

### Step 5 — Guard

Add Lighthouse CI budget, bundle-size check, or perf test on the hot path.

---

## When NOT to use

- No evidence of a problem and no stated budget
- Micro-optimizing cold paths while hot paths are unmeasured
- Replacing architecture before profiling

---

## Gotchas

- Synthetic scores ≠ real-user experience — use both.
- Optimizing the wrong layer (CSS when the DB is the bottleneck).
- Caching without invalidation creates subtle bugs.
- Bundle "tree-shaking" claims without measuring shipped bytes.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "It feels fast on my machine" | Your machine is not production traffic or network. |
| "We'll add monitoring later" | Without baselines you cannot prove improvement. |
| "Let's rewrite in Rust" | Profile first — often the query or algorithm is the issue. |
| "Lighthouse is enough" | Lab scores miss real devices and cache states. |
| "Ship now, optimize later" | Regressions are cheaper to block in CI than fix in prod. |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Performance report — [area]

Baseline: [metrics + how measured]
Bottleneck: [evidence]
Change: [what]
After: [metrics]
Guard: [CI/monitoring added]
```

## Examples

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>"Homepage LCP is 5s in CrUX."</input>
    <output>Measure LCP element (hero image). Compress, preload, fix CLS from font swap. Re-run Lighthouse + verify CrUX trend.</output>
  </example>
</examples>

---

## Verification

- [ ] Baseline captured with method and environment noted
- [ ] Bottleneck identified with evidence (not assumption)
- [ ] After metrics show improvement on the same probe
- [ ] Regression guard added or explicitly deferred with reason
- [ ] No premature micro-opts on unmeasured paths

---

## Red Flags

- Optimization started without baseline measurement
- CSS or frontend tuned while DB is actual bottleneck
- Multiple changes shipped — win cannot be attributed
- Synthetic score improved but real-user metrics flat
