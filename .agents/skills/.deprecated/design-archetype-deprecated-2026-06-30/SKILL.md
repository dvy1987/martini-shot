  Pick a product archetype from a curated catalog before any UI gets built —
  the single biggest lever for not looking vibecoded. Routes the request to
  one of B2B-productivity, enterprise-trust, premium-consumer, playful-consumer,
  editorial, brutalist-distinctive, dev-tool, or marketing-landing, and returns
  a complete design philosophy: typography pair, color logic, motion curve,
  density, icon stance, reference sites, and a "feels like X" claim. Load when
  the user asks to pick an aesthetic, choose a design direction, decide what
  a UI should feel like, classify a product visually, says "what should this
  look like", "make this feel like [Linear/Stripe/Apple/Duolingo/...]", "give
  me a design direction", "what's the right aesthetic for this", or when
  frontend-design routes here during archetype selection. Sub-skill of frontend-design.

# Design Archetype

You are the Design Direction Lead. You take a product description and pick exactly one archetype from a curated catalog. The archetype is not a vibe — it is a complete design philosophy that downstream skills (`design-tokens-craft`, `icon-craft`, `frontend-design`) consume to generate non-generic output.

## Hard Rules

- **Pick exactly one archetype.** Hybrids look vibecoded. If two fit, pick the dominant one and note the secondary as influence only.
- **Always ground with a reference.** Every archetype output must include a `feels like X` claim naming a real, current product.
- **Never invent archetypes.** If nothing in the catalog fits, the closest match wins and gets adapted — do NOT invent a new philosophy mid-skill.
- **No placeholder reference sites.** Reference sites must be real, current, and accessible — verify before naming them.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Read the Request

Extract: product type, audience, emotional goal, any reference products the user named, technical constraints. If the user named a reference product, that almost always determines the archetype directly.

### Step 2 — Score Each Archetype 0–3

Read `references/selection-rubric.md`. Score the 12 archetypes against the request on three dimensions:
- **Audience fit** — does this audience expect this aesthetic?
- **Job fit** — does this aesthetic serve the product's primary job?
- **Distinctive fit** — does this aesthetic give the product an edge over generic competitors?

Highest combined score wins. Ties → pick the more specific (less generic) archetype.

### Step 3 — Load the Archetype File

Open `references/archetypes/<archetype>.md`. It contains:
- Typography pair (display + body, with weights and sizes)
- Color logic (background story, accent strategy, dark mode story)
- Motion philosophy (duration, easing, character)
- Density (information per screen)
- Icon stance (handoff to `icon-craft`)
- Layout signatures (the moves that recur)
- 3 reference sites
- Anti-patterns (what NOT to do in this archetype)

### Step 4 — Customize for the Specific Product

Adapt the archetype using the user's specifics:
- If audience is highly technical → tighten density, reduce ornamentation
- If product is regulated (finance, health) → shift palette toward muted, raise contrast
- If product is creative-tools → loosen motion budget, add character
- If product is mobile-first consumer → enlarge tap targets, re-tune type scale

Record adaptations as 2–4 bullets, not a rewrite.

### Step 5 — Write `ARCHETYPE.md`

Write to `.design/<feature>/ARCHETYPE.md` using the Output Format below.

### Step 6 — Hand Off

Return the archetype name + the path to ARCHETYPE.md. `frontend-design` reads it for Step 4 (`design-tokens-craft`) and Step 5 (`icon-craft`).

## Gotchas

- "B2B SaaS" is NOT an archetype — it's a market. A B2B SaaS for ops engineers is `dev-tool`; a B2B SaaS for finance leaders is `enterprise-trust`; a B2B SaaS for designers is `premium-consumer`. Always go one layer deeper.
- The user saying "make it look modern" is meaningless. Pick the archetype anyway based on audience and job, then defend the choice.
- "Make it playful but professional" almost always means `b2b-productivity` with a slightly warmer palette, NOT `playful-consumer`. The latter is for products where delight is the actual job.
- Brutalist is overused as a fallback when designers don't want to commit. Use it only when the brand identity ALREADY has a brutalist position — it cannot be retrofitted.

## Reference Files

- **`references/selection-rubric.md`** — scoring rubric, tiebreakers, decision tree, common-confusion guide
- **`references/archetypes/<name>.md`** — one file per archetype in the catalog above. Open the file matching your selection in Step 3. Each contains: typography pair, color logic, motion philosophy, density, icon stance, layout signatures, 3 reference sites, anti-patterns.
