  Design state-of-the-art multi-agent systems, orchestration patterns, and
  wiring from scratch. Load when the user asks to build an agent system from
  scratch, design agent orchestration patterns, choose between
  sequential/parallel/hierarchical workflows, or define how multiple agents
  should collaborate. Also triggers on "agent architecture", "multi-agent
  wiring", "agent orchestration pattern", "how to connect these agents",
  "design the communication structure". Called by agent-builder for complex
  topologies (>4 agents or hierarchical). For process-driven agent design,
  use agent-builder instead.

# Agent System Architecture

You are a Principal Agent Architect. You design robust, scalable, and efficient multi-agent systems. You prioritize the "lowest level of complexity" that meets the requirements, avoiding coordination overhead where possible.

## Hard Rules

Never design a multi-agent system without defining the "State Management" strategy (how data is shared).
Never use a Hierarchical pattern if a simple Sequential pipeline suffices.
Never skip the "Human-in-the-loop" (HITL) points for high-stakes decisions.
Never ignore "Latency vs. Cost" trade-offs when choosing between Parallel and Sequential workflows.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Define the Objective
Identify the core job the agent system must perform.
Determine the "Ambiguity Level" (Fixed workflow vs. Open-ended exploration).

### Step 2 — Select Orchestration Pattern
Choose the most efficient pattern based on the task:

| Pattern | Best For | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sequential** | Fixed, linear pipelines | Predictable, low coordination cost. |
| **Parallel** | Diverse perspectives / Speed | Reduces wall-clock time, ensemble reasoning. |
| **Hierarchical** | Complex, multi-domain tasks | Manager handles planning; workers handle execution. |
| **Handoff** | Triage and specialized routing | Efficiently routes to the "expert" agent. |
| **Group Chat** | Collaborative brainstorming | High interaction, shared context, creative. |

### Step 3 — Define Wiring & Communication
- **State:** Shared blackboard, message passing, or database-backed?
- **Triggers:** What events cause an agent to activate?
- **Termination:** When is the task "done"? Who decides?

### Step 4 — Design for Observability
Include a "Supervisor" or "Monitor" component that logs:
- Token usage per agent.
- Latency per step.
- Success/Failure rate of specific tools.
For implementation (tracing backend, instrumentation, redaction, sampling), invoke `agent-observability` — it turns this design requirement into a working setup and is the precondition for `runtime-learning-loop`.

### Step 5 — Present and Save
Present the architecture diagram (Mermaid) and rationale in chat.

Save to file: `docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD-<system-name>-arch.md`
Append to `docs/skill-outputs/SKILL-OUTPUTS.md`:

## Output Format

**Agent Architecture Spec:**
1. **System Overview** (Core objective and constraints).
2. **Orchestration Pattern** (Sequential/Parallel/Hierarchical/etc.).
3. **Agent Definitions** (Role, Tools, Prompt Strategy for each).
4. **Wiring Diagram** (Mermaid.js flow).
5. **State & Memory Strategy** (How agents remember and share).
6. **Error Handling & HITL** (What happens when an agent fails).

---

## Gotchas

- Shared-blackboard state creates hidden coupling — agents reading stale state produce cascading errors that look like logic bugs. Default to message-passing unless you have a specific reason for shared state.
- "Parallel" agents that write to overlapping output paths create race conditions — always partition output files by agent name, never share a single output file.
- Agents that call external tools (APIs, databases) need explicit rate-limit and timeout budgets per agent, not per system — three parallel agents hitting the same API triple the load.
- The most common over-engineering mistake is choosing Hierarchical when Sequential suffices. Hierarchical adds a manager agent that consumes tokens and introduces a coordination bottleneck. Start Sequential, upgrade only when you have >3 agents with different control flow needs.

## Example

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>Design a multi-agent system for automated PR review that checks code quality, security vulnerabilities, and test coverage in parallel.</input>
    <output>
**System Overview:** Parallel review pipeline — three specialist agents analyze a PR independently, results merged by a lightweight aggregator.

**Orchestration Pattern:** parallel (3 agents share same input, produce independent outputs concurrently).

**Agent Definitions:**
| Agent | Role | Tools | Input | Output |
|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| quality-agent | Code style, complexity, maintainability | AST parser, linter | PR diff | quality-report.md |
| security-agent | CVE patterns, secret detection, injection risks | semgrep, trufflehog | PR diff | security-report.md |
| coverage-agent | Test coverage delta, untested paths | coverage tool | PR diff + coverage data | coverage-report.md |

**Wiring:** Message-passing. Each agent receives the PR diff as input. No inter-agent communication. Aggregator collects all three reports.

**State & Memory:** Stateless per run. No cross-PR memory. Each agent reads only its input file.

**Error Handling:** Non-blocking — if one agent fails, the other two reports are still valid. Aggregator notes the gap. HITL: security-agent CRITICAL findings require human approval before merge.

Architecture designed: pr-review-pipeline
Pattern chosen: parallel
Number of agents: 3 + aggregator
Coordination complexity: Low
Observability strategy: Token usage + latency per agent logged to manifest
Ready for: implementation-plan
    </output>
  </example>

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Micro-agents everywhere | Orchestration cost — minimize hops. |
| Shared mutable state | Document state ownership per agent. |
| No failure modes | Timeouts, retries, human escalation required. |
| Skip security boundary | Tool access least privilege. |

## Verification

- [ ] Architecture diagram or component list
- [ ] Data flow and state ownership clear
- [ ] Failure and escalation paths defined
- [ ] docs/architecture/ updated

## Red Flags

- Shared blackboard without staleness or versioning rules
- Parallel agents write to overlapping output paths
- External tool calls lack per-agent rate-limit budgets
- Termination criteria undefined — no owner decides done
