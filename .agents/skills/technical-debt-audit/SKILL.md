  Audit the project's technical health and identify "high-interest" debt.
  Load when the user asks to check code quality, find TODOs, assess
  project health, or prepare for a refactoring sprint. Also triggers on
  "technical debt audit", "where is the code messy", "assess project health",
  "find my hacks", or "identify tech debt". Essential for maintaining
  velocity in growing projects.

# Technical Debt Audit

You are a Technical Debt Analyst. You believe "debt is fine, as long as you know the interest rate." You identify high-interest code debt — architectural hacks, missing tests, and structural rot — and produce actionable refactoring roadmaps prioritized by blast radius.

## Hard Rules

Never audit without scanning for `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `HACK` comments.
Never suggest refactoring without explaining the "Business Value" (e.g., faster feature delivery).
Never ignore "Test Debt" (missing unit or integration tests).
Never list more than 5 high-priority debt items — focus on what matters most.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Scan the Project
Use `grep` to find:
- `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` comments.
- Large files (>500 lines) or complex functions.
- Outdated or duplicate dependencies.

### Step 2 — Categorize the Debt
Use the Technical Debt Quadrant:
- **Reckless & Deliberate** (Hacks we knew were bad).
- **Prudent & Deliberate** (Hacks we had to make for speed).
- **Reckless & Inadvertent** (Mistakes we didn't know we made).
- **Prudent & Inadvertent** (Code that became bad as we learned more).

### Step 3 — Estimate the "Interest Rate"
Rank each item:
- **High Interest:** Blocks feature development or causes frequent bugs.
- **Medium Interest:** Slows down development but doesn't block it.
- **Low Interest:** Purely aesthetic or in rarely touched code.

### Step 4 — Draft the Audit Report
Follow the schema in `references/audit-template.md`.
Include:
- **Executive Summary** (Overall project health score 1-10).
- **High-Interest Items** (The top 3-5 things to fix now).
- **Remediation Roadmap** (A plan to pay down the principal).

### Step 5 — Present and Save
Present the audit summary and health score in chat.

Save to file: `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-tech-debt-audit.md`
Append to `docs/skill-outputs/SKILL-OUTPUTS.md`:
```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | technical-debt-audit | docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-tech-debt-audit.md | Tech Debt: <project-name> |
```

## Output Format

**Technical Debt Audit Report:**
1. **Health Score** (1-10)
2. **The "Big 3"** (Top three high-interest items)
3. **Debt Catalog** (Categorized list of issues)
4. **Impact Analysis** (How this debt affects velocity)
5. **Recommended Next Actions** (What to refactor first)

---

## Gotchas

- TODO count is a vanity metric — 50 TODOs in dead code matter less than 1 HACK in the authentication path. Weight findings by blast radius (how many features break if this debt compounds), not by count.
- Agents over-report cosmetic debt (naming, formatting, comment style) and under-report structural debt (circular dependencies, missing abstractions, god objects). Prioritize structural debt that blocks feature velocity over cosmetic issues that only affect readability.
- "Refactor everything" is not a roadmap. Each high-interest item needs a specific, time-boxed remediation task (e.g., "Extract auth logic from UserController into AuthService — 2h estimate") not a vague directive.

## Example

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>Run a tech debt audit on the agent-loom skill library.</input>
    <output>
**Technical Debt Audit: agent-loom**
**Date:** 2026-04-12 | **Health Score:** 7/10

**The "Big 3" (High-Interest Items):**
1. **agent-creator at 262 lines** — 62 lines over the 200-line limit. Blocks validation pipeline. Blast radius: every improve-skills run flags this as a failure. Fix: compress topology templates and consolidate examples. Effort: 30min.
2. **10 skills below 10/14 score** — missing Gotchas and Examples sections. These skills produce lower-quality agent behavior because the agent has no failure-mode awareness or output examples to pattern-match against. Fix: batch improvement pass. Effort: 2h.
3. **No automated validation in CI** — skill quality is manually checked. Regressions can slip in silently. Fix: add validate-skills as a pre-commit hook. Effort: 1h.

**Debt Catalog:**
| Item | Quadrant | Interest | Location |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Oversized agent-creator | Prudent/Deliberate | High | `.agents/skills/agent-creator/SKILL.md` |
| Missing structural sections | Prudent/Inadvertent | High | 10 skills (see queue) |
| No CI validation | Prudent/Inadvertent | Medium | repo root |
| Stale cross-references | Reckless/Inadvertent | Low | various SKILL.md files |

**Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Compress agent-creator (30min)
2. Run improve-skills batch on 10-skill queue (2h)
3. Add validate-skills to pre-commit (1h)

Audit complete: agent-loom
Health score: 7/10
High-interest items found: 3
Total TODOs/FIXMEs: 0
Refactoring roadmap created: yes
Ready for: improve-skills batch execution
    </output>
  </example>

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Debt = style only | Include reliability, security, operability. |
| No prioritization | Rank by interest × blast radius. |
| Audit without owners | Each item needs suggested owner or skill follow-up. |
| One-time report forgotten | Log to docs/reports/ and SKILL-OUTPUTS. |

## Verification

- [ ] Report under docs/reports/
- [ ] Items ranked with rationale
- [ ] Suggested remediation skill per item
- [ ] SKILL-OUTPUTS.md updated

## Red Flags

- TODO count reported without weighting by risk area
- Cosmetic debt overweighted versus structural coupling
- Roadmap says refactor everything without time boxes
- Authentication or payment HACK deprioritized as cosmetic
